#step 3=optimizing data for enhanced clustering 
 We did this so we would have the date of each invoice distinctly on daily basis
in our data. This is important because as the data is going to be stored and
analyzed based on different days and often the data is grouped according to
different days. Thus, the presence of the (`InvoiceDay`) column enables time-
based analyses that are more diverse than the rates specified by the cardinality
of a month.


train_data['InvoiceDay'] = train_data['InvoiceDate'].apply(lambda x:dt.datetime(x.year, x.month, x.day))
train_data.head()



"Finding Last Purchase Date for Customer Management":
Now, we want to find the last purchase date of customers to perform proper
clustering. This is because the date of the customers' last purchase can be a
crucial point for applications or marketing strategies. Therefore, these codes
are used for better customer management and planning, allowing us to cluster
customers effectively based on their last purchase date.


dt.timedelta(1)
pin_date = max(train_data['InvoiceDay']) + dt.timedelta(1)
pin_date


"creating 'totalsum'variable for financial analysis ":

train_data['TotalSum'] = train_data['Quantity'] * train_data['UnitPrice']
train_data.head()

creating RFM variable for customr analysis and marketing stratigies:

rfm = train_data.groupby('CustomerID').agg({
'InvoiceDay': lambda x: (pin_date - x.max()).days,
'InvoiceNo': 'count',
'TotalSum': 'sum'
})
rfm


# To sum up,
this code was produced with intention of creating for each customer Recency,
Frequency, Monetary variables known as RFM. These three variables hold
significant importance in customer analysis and marketing strategies:
I. Recency (R): This variable informs us on the days that have elapsed since the
last purchase that was made by the customer. Such means, we can calculate the
number of days since the last purchase and define customersâ€™ activity level and
additional influencing them if needed.
2. Frequency (F): This variable holds information about the total number of
purchases that has been done by the customer. Such information assists us in
ascertaining individuals who frequently patronize our products and services;
therefore, we offer them some promos and coupons.
3. Monetary (M): This variable is used to indicate the total expenditure of the
customer to be able to make any purchases. And it helps to identify customers who
spend more and assign them to the valuable and prospective customers group. With
the help of this code, it is easy to group the customers and classify them such
as according to the recent activity of the customer, how frequently the customer
has made the purchases and how much the customer spends. It also helps classify
our decision making in the areas of marketing and advertising so as to make
proper customer centric strategies.#
